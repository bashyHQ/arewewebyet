title: "Templating in rust"

level: 4

intro: No Web-App is complete if it doesn't spit out HTML at least some of the time. Managing that, and making sure it renders performant and can be maintained is what templating libraries focus on. There aren't many yet, but it's better than none!

packages:
 - handlebars
 - handlebars-iron
 - maud
 - liquid
 - horrorshow
 - dtl
 - rustache
 - twig
 - polly
 - tera
 - askama
 - ructe
